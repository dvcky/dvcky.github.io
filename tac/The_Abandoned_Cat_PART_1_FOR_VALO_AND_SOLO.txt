( PS: The boy can understand cat language xD )
Onces upon a time there was a cat named Tiffany. Tiff was very lazy, she liked sleeping a lot.
One day, tha lazy cat found a young boy. He was tall but didn't look very old...
-Miaow? (Tiff the cat said: Who are you? )
-I'm Valo, said the boy, Are you....Abandoned?
-Miaow.... (Tiff the cat said: Yes....)
-What happend? Asked Valo.
-Miaow, miaow miaow miaow miaow. ( Tiff the cat said: Well it was a curse....I don't know the reason why. )
-Hmm I think I can help you with that. Said the boy taking out his phone

A few minutes later I ( Tiffany ) was in Valos arms while he was making his way to someone's house. 5 minutes later we were standing in front of a tall and large house. The boy knocked with confidence, and the answer to who that person was is now answered.
A women who, honnestly looked like a witch greeted us with a big smile. Personally I ( Tiff  and PS: each time I say "I" the "I" is Tiff the cat ) was kinda ( REALLY ) scared...
-Hi Chloe, said Valo, My friend has been cursed into a cat and she doesn't know why, he explained, Can you transforme her back?
-I'm afraid I can't, Chloe said seeming depressed, But I think I may have another solution. I can make her be human at day but when the clocks hit midnight, she get's transformed back to a cat.
-Yes thats exactly what we need!

Before I knew it, I was back to my human-self onces again.

VALO'S POV
Thinking: Wow....Shes so pretty.....
Thinking: VALO! Snap back to reality you have a girlfriend! That's the only girl you love not that cat person.
-Wow...I'm human again.. Tiffany whispered
-Just to be safe Tiffany you will be going to the same school as Valo since no one can find out about you're cat self alright?
-Okay...

NEXT DAY

-TIFF!!! yelled Valo from the kitchen, GET YOUR BUTT DOWN HERE!
-GIVE ME 5 MORE MINUTES VALO!
-DON'T MAKE ME COME UP THERE! continued yelling Valo half through the stairs, IM GOING WITHOUT YOU IF YOU DONT HURRY!
-Fine! hesitated Tiffany before getting out of bed, Just don't come in..

TO BE CONTINUED........
