LATER THAT DAY

VALO'S POV
Thinking: She's so cute when she's asleep...But I have a bad feeling my girlfriend er ex girlfriend is after Tiff..

A few secounds later I was running my hand through her hair when  I heard something unusual
Thinking: Is that what Tiffany heard? I better go see what it is if I want answers...
And so I went downstairs carefully but the secound I got there, silence..

-VALO!!! yelled Tiffany, VALO HELP!!!
I ran to her room as fast as I could, the only thing I saw was Tiff with more scars...And It was my fault this time...
I could feel tears coming down my face, I slowly sat down next to Tiff, but I knew she wasn't going to wake up any time soon.

TIFFANY'S POV

I was asleep but that scene kept playing in my head...
"VALO! VALO HELP!..." "VALO HURRY PLEASE!!!"
I could feel tears coming down my cheeks and I knew Valo was sitting right next to me. And so I opened my eyes..
-Tiffany, are you okay? He asked, clearly he was crying and very conserned.
- I-I'm fine...
-I'm so sorry, it's my fault!!
-Valo what are you talking about its not your fault!!
-IT IS! He yelled, It is my fault, I'm the reason your hurt...

I slowly closed my eyes, I had no control of what I was doing. everything went black...
-Tiff? TIFFANY! TIFFANY WAKE UP! Valo who was clearly terrified took his phone out and called an ambulance
-Hello? Yes my friend just fainted and she has a lot of scars on her arms, please hurry!
-Come on Tiff wake up! Please!...
