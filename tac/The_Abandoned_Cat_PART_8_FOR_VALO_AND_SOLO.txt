-WHAT'S HAPPENING?! Yelled Tiffany, petrified
-I don't know!

I looked at the building onces more and saw something I could never unsee..

She looked scared and sad, I could see her staring to tear up, so I held her closer.
The building was on fire, burning down. And I knew exactly who did it...
- V-Valo..

-Whats a Taco fuel? Asked Valo, clearly confused.
-M-My l-life e-energy..

TIFFANY'S POV

-CHLOE!!! Yelled Valo
-What do you want?
-WHY DID YOU STEAL IT AND WHY DID YOU BURN DOWN THE HOSPITAL?!
Valo kept yelling louder and louder...
-Well, first of all I did steal what I needed to make her suffer for what she has done, second I wasn't the one to burn down the hospital. Chloe explained
-What has Tiffany ever done to you?!
-Oh Valo, YOUR CLUELESS! Back when I was a child, she was so nice..When my 14th birthday came, she turned on me and started hurting me!
-Um Chloe... That wasn't me...That was my mother,se also got cursed as a cat. Tiffany Explained
-Wait so that wasn't you?
-No! I was still 4 year old girl
-So all this time...
-If you'll excuse us, we have to get back home. Bye. Valo said but before closing the door, he gave Chloe a cold look..

VALO'S POV

I was in my bed, reading when i felt something worm and furry next to my arm. I looked to see what it was, it was little kitty Tiffany. I put my book down and put her on my knees.
