AT THE HOSPITAL

VALO'S POV

She was just lying there unconscious, it was scary thinking she could die...
I was deep in my thoughts when I heard the door slam. It was Chloe.
-What are you doing here? Asked the young boy.
-Am I not allowed to help my friend in a bad situation?
-Yes but-
The boy was interropted by his witch friend
-But you're affraid she might die. Chloe said, You know she is half cat so she still has a lot of time too live.
-Not funny..
-Come on Valo cheer up! 
-Not intil she wakes up
-Why do you care so much about her anyways?! Chloe said fustrated
-Huh?
I wasn't expecting her to ask me that..And honnestly, I don't know why I care about her so much...
- You heard me, why do you care so much about her?! She was cursed for a reason you know! You can't just go and come too me everytime you see someone cursed! DID YOU EVER THINK OF WHAT SHE DID TO GET CURSED?! yelled the witch
I could see she was angry but I never saw this side of her...
-What has gotten into you?! You used to be my bestfriend!
- U-used?? she repeated
-You heard me.
-Fine then, you know I could kill you're friend t this exact moment you know? 
Just the thought of it made me cry.
-DON'T! GET OUT NOW!
-Why should I?
-DOCTOR! PLEASE COME THIS WOMEN SAID SHE COULD KILL HER AT THIS MOMENT!!!
-Stop yelling!!! Told Chloe, This isn't over...
-I think it is.
