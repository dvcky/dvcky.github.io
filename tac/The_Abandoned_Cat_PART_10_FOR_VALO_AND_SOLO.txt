I also met a girl named Bri that's also very nice. But back to my story, I was finishing homework when I saw a huge spider on the wall, I couldn't help but scream.

-What happened?! Valo said rushing in
-SPIDER!!!
-Where? He asked

I pointed at the big spider and in less than three seconds Valo smacked it.

-There, he said, now dinner will be ready in a few minutes.
-Alright, I responded

VALO'S POV

I went down to continue dinner, when Tiffany screamed (again). So, I whent up again just to find Tiff with scars and bruises. There was a lot of blood on the floor. She was knocked out.

I whent down to grab a mop to clean up the blood when I heard a window shatter.

-Well..., I started
