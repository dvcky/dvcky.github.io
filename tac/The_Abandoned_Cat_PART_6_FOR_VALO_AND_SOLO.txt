THE NEXT MORNING

VALO'S POV

I was reading a book when I heard Tiffany screaming, I whent up as fast as I could and when I was in her room..All I saw was Tiffany on the floor covered in blood. There was lots of blood on the floor...And on the walls were writen "The more you let her alone, the more pain you get." in want looked like blood...
- T- Tiffany?
- V-Valo...
It was only a few secounds before she got up.
A few minutes later we were talking on the bed and she told me what happend.
-I'm sorry I wasn't there Tiff...
- It's okay Valo...
Her voice was low so I knew there was something wrong, but before I could ask her she fainted on my chest...
I obviously called the ambulance.
Thinking: Not again!!
