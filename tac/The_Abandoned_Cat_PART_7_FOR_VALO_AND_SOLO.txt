AT THE HOSPITAL

 VALO'S POV

Thinking: Why does this keep happening?! What did she ever do wrong?...

-Sir, said the nurse, your friend is fine but-
-What is it?
- May I ask, continued the nurse, how did this happen?
-Well..., I said, I'm trying to figure it out myself. All I know is that everytime I leave her someone comes and hurts her..
-Police are outside and waiting for you to answer some questions but if you'd like I could go and answer them myself from what you told me since you seem so scared too leave her...
-Thank you..
Thinking: Is it just me or is Tiffany waking up..

TIFFANY'S POV

- W-what h-happend...?
-You're awake? Asked Valo
- I think-

Before I could say anything else, Valo put his hand in front of my mouth. As a sign for me to stop talking. Slowly he came closer to my face. I couldn't move because he was holding me put in one place. He started kissing me and since I hade nothing to do I kissed him back. Surprisingly I felt safe...
- EVERYONE GET OUT OF THE HOSPITAL AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE THIS IS AN EMERGENCY!
