VALO'S POV
Thoughts were racing in my mind but the only answer that I came up with was...
Chloe.
I looked around, starting to panic. Chloe was watching us but from where?
- Tiff I need you to hide. I don't care where but just go somewhere no one will find you, I explained quickly before pushing her out of the room.
- Why? She asked
- Chloe. She's watching us. She made your scars dissapear.
- \O-okay.. She said before turning into a cat and running away.
I start looking around the house and out the windows to try to find any sign of the witch, with no success.
I open the front door looking outside. I take a look around the outside of the house, hearing a sound coming from inside the house. "SHIT!!" I thought "I LEFT THE FRONT DOOR OPEN!" I hurry to the door, closing it behind me before grabbing my phone and calling the police.
- 911, what's your emergency? A voice said from the other side of the line.
- A witch broke inside my house!
- Sir, please stay calm, where do you live?
- **** ****************.
- We will be there as soon as possible.
We're the last things he said before ending the call. He said that 10 MINUTES AGO. I start to panic again, grabbing a knife from the kitchen before going to look for Tiff. I hope she's okay.

TIFF'S POV

I stay in my hiding spot. In the porch behind the many things that are bigger than me in cat form.
Suddenly I hear footsteps. A lot lighter than Valo's so I'm assuming its Chloe. Scared I try to make as little sound as possible.

- Oh Tiffany!!~ Chloe says
- Where are you??~~ She says, before sticking her arm into the porch hole tossing the big objects, reveling me.
- There you are~ She says with a sadistic smile on her face. 

The evil witch grabbed my small body before...........
