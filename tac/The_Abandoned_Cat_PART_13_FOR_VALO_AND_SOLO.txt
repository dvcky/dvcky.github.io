VALO'S POV

..........Tiff..... S-she's......
- GET AWAY FROM HER! I yelled
Chloe jumped and let go of Tiff's tail. I could faintly hear the police sirens coming closer to us.
- I guess it's time for me to go, she said before vanishing into thin air.
(Changing the speech thingy because I can and feel like its better ;-;)
"DAMN IT!" I yelled, punching the wall
"Sir, we are currently searching the house but there seems to be no witch in sight.. Are you sure someone broke into your house?" The police officer asked
"Yes I'm sure! She just vanished right in front of me!" I tell him, speaking louder and louder
"Sir, I think you need to sit down. There was no witch inside of your house and no sign of a break in. You need to calm down and get some rest" The officer said, trying to calm me down
"I DON'T NEED REST! I JUST WANT THAT STUPID WITCH TO STOP BOTHERING ME AND AND THOSE AROUND ME!" I yell, trying extremely hard not to punch him in face
"SIR CALM DOWN" He said loudly, attracting the attention of other police officers
"Is everything alright John?" Another officer asked
"Yes, everything is perfectly fine" John replied to the man, in a slightly frustrated tone
"Alright," The other officer said "We should get going. Come on John"
"Are you actually not going to do anything about this?!" I said loudly surprised that they were letting it go so easily
NO ONE'S POV
The police offices were too far way to hear Valo and left. He was left on his own, frustrated at how they were so indifferent and desperately wondering what he was going to do to end this mess.
A/N: Sorry this took so long! I started this part a while ago and never got to finish it (as you could tell from the way the characters talking changed). I just had no interesting "story" in mind and still don't so once again, sorry for the long wait!
