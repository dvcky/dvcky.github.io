AT SCHOOL

TIFF'S POV

Valo's school was huge. He showed me around intil..Someone came. I figured it was his girlfriend who, at first sight didn't really like me.
Later that day, I didn't make any friends because, most of them thought I was weird or just talked to me because I was Valo's friend...So as you can see I didn't go very well......

AT HOME

When I was about to go to bed..I heard somthing unusual. I went downstairs to see what was going on and next thing I knew I was laying there, eyes closed..
When I woke up, I felt very small...I looked down seeing four paws insted of two legs. I figured I was a cat again and when I was about to look up at who is holding me, the person started slowly touching my cat ears. At that moment I knew that was Valo, but something was diffrent..Like if he was sad...
-Miaow? ( Tiff said: Are you okay? )
-Yeah just..I shoudn't have left you all alone..
-Miaow.. ( Tiff said: Its okay, don't be sad because of that. )
-I know, he said holding his little cat friend closer to him and looking down so they're eyes meet, then smiled.
-Miaow ( Tiff said: Why are you smiling Valo..? )
-Because, he said as he put his cat friend on the bed, you gonna transforme back into a human.

He was right. though I was human again, something felt wrong...I looked at my arm seeing a big scar.
-Whats this, Valo asked looking at Tiffany's arm, When did you get that?
-I got that when I fainted, explained Tiffany, It doesn't hurt though.
-Hmm strange, well- wait how did you faint anyway?
-Well, I heard an unusual sound coming from down stairs so I whent to check it out and then I fainted.
-Thats weird, because when I came home it was total silence...
-Valo I'm scared...
-Don't be, said the young boy, we'll find out who is after you, I promise.

Those were the last words I heard before falling asleep on his chest.
