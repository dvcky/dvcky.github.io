The school was filled with people and everyone was staring at us..At first I thought it was obvious that I had a small crush on Tiffany but I guess she still didn't know...

A few hours later school was over.
Me and Tiff whent home and Tiffany I think you know the first thing she did....Sleep of course.

-Tiff, said the young boy waking up his cat friend, Can you not sleep for onces?
-No..Let me sleep Valo...
-Hmm...No, Valo said.
-Why are you so meannn? Asked Tiffany almost sounding like she was crying.
-Because, Valo said sitting down on the bed right next to her, I'm Valo
-Valo...You're a bit too close...
-Am I? he said as he moved close to her.
-What are you-
She didn't have time to finish, Valo was kissing her and she knew she couldn't stop him.
