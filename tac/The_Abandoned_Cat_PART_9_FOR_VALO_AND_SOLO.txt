THE NEXT DAY
TIFFANY'S POV

I woke up, but this time it felt diffrent.... I looked up and saw Valo, sound asleep.
Thinking: I must have fallen asleep on him..
And with that thought I was blushing.

VALO'S POV

I woke up and saw Tiffany's tomato face, I couldn't stop myself from laughing.

- H-HEY! STOP LAUGHING!! yelled Tiffany, still red like a tomato
-Nothing he laughed, Just your face, its pretty cute to see you blushing
- W-what? she asked, her face turning back to normal
-Oh nothing, he said, Let's go get breakfast.
-Can I have tacos? She asked
Tiffany's face lit up after that question, I couldn't say no.
-Sure come on.

AFTER BREAKFAST

-What do you want to do now? She asked
-I don't know, what do you want to do? he asked
-Sleep.
-But we just woke up, he laughed
-BUT I'M SLEEPYYYYYYYYY!! she yelled
-Alright then go to sleep.. he said
-But your coming with me! she said

Tiff took my hand and dragged me all the way to the bedroom. I sat down on the bed, while she layed down.
-Goodnight little kitten. he whispered

THE NEXT MORNING

TIFFANY'S POV

I woke up with a big pain on my arms, I looked and saw 7 scars.
- V-Valo... she said with a small voice
- Yeah?
- W-when did I get these?
Valo looked at my scars, terrified
- I.. don't know...
I was scared and Valo could see that.

VALO'S POV

I held her as close to me as I could.
-I won't let anyone hurt you under my watch..
